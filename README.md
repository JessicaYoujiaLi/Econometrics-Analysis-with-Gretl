In the book, _The Spirit Level_, the authors Kate Pickett and Richard G.Wilkinson use statistical analysis to  indicate that the increasing income inequality, measured by Gini coefficient, intensifies a range of social problems internationally and across the states in the U.S. However, this book received many criticisms in suggesting some more appropoariate frameworks to recalibrate the conclusion. Based on the critisim, the goal of my project is to assess whether the income inequality can be an account for a series of social outcomes in the United States through **Ordinary Least Squares Regrassion Modeling** and **Hypothesis Testing**, and if there are any other better explanatory variables for these problems, in order to paint a fuller picture of what factors drive American society the way it is, and if reducing inequality is the main way to resolve these problems.
